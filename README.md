# Ruby Project
## For fun
1.  The last time I saw ruby code, was in the 7th semester of undergrad, haha.
2.  Now, I am planning to learn it (finally!)
3.  Will be following Head First Ruby (which will get delivered to me by Dec 10th, 2015)
4.  Lets hope that I can learn this fast enough :D

## Reflections a year and a half later
1. Ruby (with Rails) has now become my profession, and is my principle language.
2. Funny how things you learg n for fun can help you in a pinch.
